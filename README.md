# Digital-Payment-Monitoring-Framework-Java-Collections
💳 Digital Payment Monitoring Framework – Java Collections
📌 Project Overview

The Digital Payment Monitoring Framework is a console-based backend simulation built using Core Java and the Java Collections Framework.

This project models how modern digital payment systems monitor transactions in real time to detect anomalies, track spending behavior, and generate alerts for suspicious activities.

The framework focuses on efficient in-memory data processing using Java Collections to simulate real-world financial monitoring logic.
